				<div className="about-text" >As a detail-oriented forward-thinker, I strive to find design solutions that are not only visually appealing but honest, clear and built on a solid foundation of understanding what I am communicating. I enjoy collaboration and problem solving and value candidness and honest conversation. With 12 years of work experience in both print and digital environments, I have been able to work on a diverse selection of projects, constantly feeding my desire to learn and grow with every task that comes my way.<br/><br/>
				I also passionately devote my time to Barbershop music and the community that comes with it.
I enjoy live music, arts and crafts, dreaming about & creating a better future, and spending time with people that inspire and uplift me.<br/>
I am curious to explore new projects and adventures in collaboration with caring, driven humans.<br/><br/>
